make sure for convex create and use new component called air
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
  1. Personalized Air Exposure Passport 🏥                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
  Create an AI-powered mobile app that generates individual "exposure passports" combining:                                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
  Real-time PM2.5, NO exposure at user's exact location (via GPS + OpenAQ data)                                                                                                                                                                              

  Smart recommendations (avoid peak traffic hours, switch to metro, indoor exercise alerts)

  Gamification: Rewards for low-exposure commutes, health streak tracking

 SDG 3– Good Health & Well-Being Urban residents face growing health risks due to worsening air quality and congested traffic in fast-developing cities. Prolonged exposure to pollutants such as PM2.5, CO₂, and NO₂ contributes to respiratory illnesses, while constant congestion increases stress levels and accident risks. Despite the availability of open datasets, city health planning often lacks real time insights, leaving vulnerable communities exposed. Develop an AI-driven solutions that integrate air quality, traffic, and health datasets to support better decision-making for healthier cities. Subtopic: 1. Air Quality & Health Risks Use AI to map pollution levels with health risks, helping cities identify danger zones. 2. Traffic & Public Health Analyse traffic congestion data to understand its effect on urban stress and accidents. 3. Smart Healthcare Access Develop AI tools that identify underserved urban areas with poor access to clinics or hospitals. Available Datasets: • OpenAQ Global Air Quality Data • DOE Malaysia Air Quality Index • World Health Organization Urban Health Data • Traffic Data From OpenStreetMap Possible Prototypes: • AI-powered air quality prediction tool • Real-time health risk alerts System • Pollution-aware route planner


make sure UI/UX is clean for desktop and mobile.. for API
